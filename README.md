# Learning Logic Gates with Minecraft

# Introduction to Programming Using the Raspberry Pi
## Summer at SLU 2014

In the summer of 2014 the founding members of EI.BO (myself included) were researching starting our own non-profit.  As part of that research we developed and taught an “Introduction to Programming Using the Raspberry Pi” for forty-five children ages 11 – 14.

This piece is just one small part of that course and was designed to be used on a projector in front of the class with a classroom interactive discussion.
